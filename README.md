## About Me:
- 📚 I'm a 3rd year standing Computer Science student from the University of the (sunny 🌞) Philippines!

Instead of sticking to one thing, I like finding problems and designing solutions that bring different areas together. Basically, I come up with an idea for something cool, then learn whatever I need to build it!
- 🌱 Other words to describe me: ambitious, curious, proactive, perfectionist
